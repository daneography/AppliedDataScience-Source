It is the utmost importance that the players are not only practicing to be the best in the field but also it is very important that they stay healthy and avoid injuries while training. If a player gets injured in training it could have some serious consequences ranging from distrupted training to getting benched for the whole season. We will use data science to find out the best regiment for players taking their training and physiology into consideration. This regiment will produce information such as optimal nutrition, recovery time, future health, and possible conditions that may put players at risk."
